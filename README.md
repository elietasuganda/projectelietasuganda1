Hi, i am Elieta Liestiani Suganda and i want to tell you my website, how do I create my website from scratch to having my own domain. I make a website about fashion and for purchase and delivery, and i deploy on Netlify with custom domain on Niagahoster. I make smooth in website when that is scroll, and make for different device. In this web I use @media (max-width: 768px) and (max-width: 480px) where if the web resolution is less than 768px and 480px then the web display will adjust. 

This is my website []()

In header class="full screen" and background image also, i used shadow-text for h1 and animation for text appears from right to left duration 5 secons and the text will change colour when 75% and 50%.

I use div class="navbar" for grouping navigation and for css I also use position: fixed so that the header does not sink when the web is scrolled down and the user will be easier to access. In navbar i make different background colour and colour text when cursor pointer.

I use div class="detail" for displaying more detailed information about something on a webpage. In h2 i use span also for different text colour in my website and animation so text appears from bottom to top.

I use div class="image-container" for images and i use hover for all image so the image will appear more when the cursor is hovered over. image-container1 position left, image-container2 position center, image-container3 position right, and for image-container4 and 5 i make position right but I added padding to the position of both, so that the position of the five images becomes a slash.

For api-server use method post, and for purchase and delivery:
1. Full name, I used a for=‘name’ label and the input type is text.
2. Email, I use the for=‘email’ label and the input type is email, so that if you don't enter an email format, there will be a warning when you click submit.
3. Phone number, I use the label for=‘number’ and the input type is number, so it cannot input other than numbers.
4. Address, I use the for=‘message’ label and textarea id=‘message’ which allows users to input more than 1 line.
5. Gender, I use select name=‘gender’ and id=‘gender’ option value=‘male’ option value="female’. Select is used to choose one option from the available options and option is used to define the choice made with the select element.
6. Select item, consists of input type=‘checkbox’, id, name, value. I use checkbox because it can select more than one option, id provides identification for the checkbox element, so that if the label is clicked then the checkbox will be ticked, name is used to name the variable, this value determines the value sent to the system, if the checkbox is not ticked, then this value will not be sent.
7. Payment method and shipping, consists of input type=‘radio’, id, name, value. I use radio because it can select only one option.
8. Button submit

In footer class="full screen" and make different colour text when cursor pointer.
